# states-and-statuses
A (very rough)<sup>^</sup> prototype for a compositional states and statuses system in Unity.

***Only statuses have been implemented so far!***

This repository is intended to be used by developers as a reference for a potential implementatoin of finite state machines and status effects.

Build controls:
- `LMB`: move towards mouse position
- `RMB`: dash towards mouse position

Statuses:
- Gigantism
    - Increases character's scale, max 3 stacks (default).
- Dashless
    - Temporarily disables character's dash option.
- Slow
    - Reduces the character's speed and dash distance, max 8 stacks (default).

<sup>^</sup> *Might be cleaned up in the future, but I'm currently using this to teach someone.*
